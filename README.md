# Connect-Club
An *online platform* to connect yourself with other classmates. :wave:

It is made using PHP, MySQL, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. :zap:

It is useful for solving doubts among peers and friends while not disturbing the class. :speak_no_evil: It helps in inculcating the discipline among students during lectures and stop the urge to speak with friends. ðŸ¤«

Made only for **Educational Purposes** !! :man_technologist:
