# Connect-Club
An *online platform* to connect with other classmates. :wave:

It is made using PHP, MySQL, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. :zap:

It is useful for solving doubts among peers and friends while not disturbing the class. :speak_no_evil: It helps in inculcating the discipline among students during lectures and stop the urge to speak with friends. ðŸ¤«

Made only for **Educational Purposes** !! :man_technologist:

## Working of the Application : 

To Sign Up for the first time, the user has to provide their ***email***, **firstName**, **lastName** and a ***unique userName*** with their **new password**. :lock:
For verification, an *email* will be sent which the user has to click in order to **initialize the application**. :email: :unlock:

Once the user has signed up, The *Login page* will contain only 2 parameters i.e., **userName/emailID** and the **password**.:new: :key:
It will be rendered using *server-side scripts*. 

After completing all these steps, the user will be *directed to the landing page* of his respective profile. :ok_hand:
